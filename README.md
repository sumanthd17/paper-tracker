Paper Tracker 
=========================

## Motivation

Over the last few months we've [AI4Bharat](https://ai4bharat.org/) read many papers in differnt domains and found that the journey to learn a new topic is a long one. In many cases it is not easy to find a good paper to start with and sometimes we overlook good papers. I've found that keeping a tab of the all the papers we read, with a brief summary and all the resources available can help other leaners to navigate the new space much easier.
