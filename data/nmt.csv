Scaling Neural Machine Translation,ACL 2018,https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00187,"Sidenote: The paper is rife with training tricks so it is also practically very useful to do efficient training. It goes into some minor details of fp16 ttraining, gradient accumulate, how to tune bs and lr in tandem etc
Some takeways based on their en-ge WMT14 task:
1) . Training with large batches is less data-efficient, but can be
parallelized and loss coverges much faster
2) Fp16 training gives 65% faster
3) They find training with large batches and by
increasing the learning rate we can further reduce
training time by 40% on a single machine
4) With above tricks and some more like grad accumulation, they speed up training by 5X on a single gpu
Towards the end of the paper, they have some notes on how data should be batched (eg by max-tokens-per-gpu or other methods) and discuss pros and conds",,"Legend himself: Myle Ott, Sergey Edunov, David Grangier, Michael Auli"
